# Anteater

A fully functional piece of bug tracking software written in Javascript and using Node, Angular and MongoDB. 
Node and Express come together to make an API back end that interacts with the MongoDB Database. This leaves Angular
to steal the show in the front end.

tl;dr - Node gives us the API. Angular gives us the frontend and accesses the API. MongoDB eats like a fat kid.


## Requirements
